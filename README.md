# DISC (Dominance, Influence, Steadiness and Complaince) Assessment

### Summary:  
Suicide is a self-inflicted act with the intent to die, while a suicide attempt involves the same intent without resulting in death. Multiple factors influence suicide risk, including exposure to violence (e.g., abuse, bullying, assault) and lack of support or healthcare access. Strong family, community ties, and accessible healthcare can reduce risk.

From 1999 to 2019, suicide rates in the U.S. rose by 33%, with nearly 47,500 deaths in 2019 aloneâ€”making it the 10th leading cause of death. The number of attempts and suicidal thoughts is significantly higher.

This investigation aims to explore key questions:

Does age influence suicide rates?

Are there gender differences in suicide risk?

Do certain variable combinations increase suicide likelihood?
